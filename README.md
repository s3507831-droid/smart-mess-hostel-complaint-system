# Smart Mess & Hostel Complaint Tracking System

This project is developed as part of GDG Fresher’s TechSprint at IIT Mandi.

## Problem
Mess and hostel complaints are traditionally recorded in physical registers,
which lack tracking and transparency.

## Solution
A digital complaint tracking system that replaces manual registers and allows
students to submit complaints online.

## MVP
This repository contains a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based MVP.
